# simul8

## Description

simul8 is an OpenGL engine meant to showcase various fundamental computer graphics concepts. Various features are in progress, and the end goal is to have a working physics simulator that allows you to play with various 3D shapes in a sandbox environment.

## Build

This project depends on the following packages:

- glew (possibly going to replace this soon)
- glfw
- glm

git submodules have been used for glfw and glm, to simplify the build process. However, the latest release of glew will need to be downloaded to build this project.
